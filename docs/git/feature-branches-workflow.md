# Feature Branches Workflow

Now that we understand how to work with remotes and remote branches,<br/>
let's discuss the approach‚Äîor rather, the workflow‚Äîused to manage them effectively.

## Why not centralized workflow ‚ÅâÔ∏è

Before I demonstrate why this approach is recommended (**Feature Branches**), let's first take a look at **what not to do (centralized workflow)**,<br>
practices that are less ideal for teamwork, especially in larger teams.

Imagine a scenario where three developers are working on the same `main` branch, <br/>
**Tomi**, **Bob** and **Alice**, and have init commit `A`.

```mermaid
%%{init: { 'gitGraph': {'showBranches': true, 'showCommitLabel':true,'mainBranchName': 'GitHub'}} }%%
gitGraph
    commit id: "A"
```

**Tomi** cloned the repo and start to work on his feature, and add two commits.

```mermaid
%%{init: { 'gitGraph': {'showBranches': true, 'showCommitLabel':true,'mainBranchName': 'main'}} }%%
gitGraph
    commit id: "A"
    commit id: "Tomi-1"
    commit id: "Tomi-2"
```

And then he pushed it to GitHub without any issues.

```mermaid
%%{init: { 'gitGraph': {'showBranches': true, 'showCommitLabel':true,'mainBranchName': 'GitHub'}} }%%
gitGraph
    commit id: "A"
    commit id: "Tomi-1"
    commit id: "Tomi-2"
```

At the same time, **Bob** is working on his feature.

```mermaid
%%{init: { 'gitGraph': {'showBranches': true, 'showCommitLabel':true,'mainBranchName': 'main'}} }%%
gitGraph
    commit id: "A"
    commit id: "Bob-1"
    commit id: "Bob-2"
```

He wants to push his changes to GitHub, but he can't because his branch is two commits behind the remote branch.<br>
So, Bob first needs to pull the latest changes and merge them with his own.<br />
Luckily for Bob, there are no conflicts. Now, he can successfully push his changes.

```mermaid
%%{init: { 'gitGraph': {'showBranches': true, 'showCommitLabel':true,'mainBranchName': 'GitHub'}} }%%
gitGraph
    commit id: "A"
    commit id: "Tomi-1"
    commit id: "Tomi-2"
    commit id: "Bob-1"
    commit id: "Bob-2"
    commit id: "merge-1"
```

After all this, poor **Alice** has been working all day on a feature and has made three commits.<br />
He wants to push her changes, but like Bob, he needs to pull the latest updates first.<br/>
Unfortunately, unlike Bob, Alice encounters multiple conflicts. <br>
After spending a lot of time, he finally managed to resolve the conflicts.

```mermaid
%%{init: { 'gitGraph': {'showBranches': true, 'showCommitLabel':true,'mainBranchName': 'GitHub'}} }%%
gitGraph
    commit id: "A"
    commit id: "Tomi-1"
    commit id: "Tomi-2"
    commit id: "Bob-1"
    commit id: "Bob-2"
    commit id: "merge-1"
    commit id: "Alice-1"
    commit id: "Alice-2"
    commit id: "Alice-3"
    commit id: "merge-2"
```

You get the idea, what happens if we have four or five developers? It starts to become overwhelming.<br />
And we haven't even discussed what happens if someone pushes code with an issue, ot not finish his feature, it could affect everyone.

## Nobody works on main

Rather then working directly on `main` ( or `master`), all new development should be done on separate branches

‚úÖ **Why Use Feature Branches?**

- Keeps `main` Stable ‚Äì Prevents unfinished or buggy code from affecting production.
- Easier Collaboration ‚Äì Developers work independently without interfering with each other.
- Enables Code Reviews ‚Äì Pull requests allow for feedback and approval before merging.
- Reduces Merge Conflicts ‚Äì Isolating changes minimizes conflicts when merging.
- Better Version Control ‚Äì Tracks features separately, making changes easier to manage.

üîÑ **Typical Workflow**

- Create a feature branch
- Work on changes and commit.
- Push the branch
- Open a pull request for review
- Merge into main once approved.

<br />
Imagine a scenario where three developers are working on the same repository, <br/>
Tomi, Bob and Alice, and have init commit `A` on the `main` branch. <br />
And every developer work on his branch

```mermaid
%%{init: { 'gitGraph': {'showBranches': true, 'showCommitLabel':true,'mainBranchName': 'main'}} }%%
gitGraph
    commit id: "A"
    branch feature-Tomi
    commit id: "Tomi-1"
    commit id: "Tomi-2"
    checkout main
    branch feature-Bob
    commit id: "Bob-1"
    commit id: "Bob-2"
    checkout main
    branch feature-Alice
    commit id: "Alice-1"
    commit id: "Alice-2"
    commit id: "Alice-3"
```

When a developer finishes their work (feature), they can merge it into `main`
> **Note**<br/>
> In a real word scenario, you don't just decide you are "happy with" a feature.<br />
> There are mechanisms for code approval and merging (pull request) that **I will cover in the next sections**.


```mermaid
%%{init: { 'gitGraph': {'showBranches': true, 'showCommitLabel':true,'mainBranchName': 'main'}} }%%
gitGraph
    commit id: "A"
    branch feature-Tomi
    commit id: "Tomi-1"
    commit id: "Tomi-2"
    checkout main
    branch feature-Bob
    commit id: "Bob-1"
    commit id: "Bob-2"
    checkout main
    branch feature-Alice
    commit id: "Alice-1"
    commit id: "Alice-2"
    commit id: "Alice-3"
    checkout main
    merge feature-Bob
    commit id: "merged"
```

> Keep in mind that branches don't have to be personal as I showed in this scenario.<br />
> The idea is to create feature branches that can be shared with some teammates without disrupting others.
